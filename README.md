## Setup Guide

Follow these micro-steps to get the Vibe Coder MCP server running and connected to your AI assistant.

### Step 1: Prerequisites

1. **Check Node.js Version:**
   * Open a terminal or command prompt.
   * Run `node -v`
   * Ensure the output shows v18.0.0 or higher (required).
   * If not installed or outdated: Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Check Git Installation:**
   * Open a terminal or command prompt.
   * Run `git --version`
   * If not installed: Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

3. **Get OpenRouter API Key:**
   * Visit [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/)
   * Create an account if you don't have one.
   * Navigate to API Keys section.
   * Create a new API key and copy it.
   * Keep this key handy for Step 4.

### Step 2: Get the Code

1. **Create a Project Directory** (optional):
   * Open a terminal or command prompt.
   * Navigate to where you want to store the project:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Documents     # Example: Change to your preferred location
     ```

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   * Run:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/freshtechbro/vibe-coder-mcp.git
     ```
     (Or use your fork's URL if applicable)

3. **Navigate to Project Directory:**
   * Run:
     ```bash
     cd vibe-coder-mcp
     ```

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script

Choose the appropriate script for your operating system:

**For Windows:**
1. In your terminal (still in the vibe-coder-mcp directory), run:
   ```batch
   setup.bat
   ```
2. Wait for the script to complete (it will install dependencies, build the project, and create necessary directories).
3. If you see any error messages, refer to the Troubleshooting section below.

**For macOS or Linux:**
1. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```
3. Wait for the script to complete.
4. If you see any error messages, refer to the Troubleshooting section below.

The script performs these actions:
* Checks Node.js version (v18+)
* Installs all dependencies via npm
* Creates necessary `VibeCoderOutput/` subdirectories (as defined in the script).
* Builds the TypeScript project.
* **Copies `.env.example` to `.env` if `.env` doesn't already exist.** You will need to edit this file.
* Sets executable permissions (on Unix systems).

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables (`.env`)

The setup script (from Step 3) automatically creates a `.env` file in the project's root directory by copying the `.env.example` template, **only if `.env` does not already exist**.

1.  **Locate and Open `.env`:** Find the `.env` file in the main `vibe-coder-mcp` directory and open it with a text editor.

2.  **Add Your OpenRouter API Key (Required):**
    *   The file contains a template based on `.env.example`:
        ```dotenv
        # OpenRouter Configuration
        ## Specifies your unique API key for accessing OpenRouter services.
        ## Replace "Your OPENROUTER_API_KEY here" with your actual key obtained from OpenRouter.ai.
        OPENROUTER_API_KEY="Your OPENROUTER_API_KEY here"

        ## Defines the base URL for the OpenRouter API endpoints.
        ## The default value is usually correct and should not need changing unless instructed otherwise.
        OPENROUTER_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1

        ## Sets the default model used as fallback when no specific model mapping is found.
        ## Uses best free reasoning model for cost-effective operations.
        DEFAULT_MODEL="deepseek/deepseek-r1-0528-qwen3-8b:free"
        ```
    *   **Crucially, replace `"Your OPENROUTER_API_KEY here"` with your actual OpenRouter API key.** Remove the quotes if your key doesn't require them.

3.  **Configure Output Directory (Optional):**
    *   To change where generated files are saved (default is `VibeCoderOutput/` inside the project), add this line to your `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        VIBE_CODER_OUTPUT_DIR=/path/to/your/desired/output/directory
        ```
    *   Replace the path with your preferred **absolute path**. Use forward slashes (`/`) for paths. If this variable is not set, the default directory (`VibeCoderOutput/`) will be used.

4.  **Configure Code-Map Generator Directory (Optional):**
    *   To specify which directory the code-map-generator tool is allowed to scan, add this line to your `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        CODE_MAP_ALLOWED_DIR=/path/to/your/source/code/directory
        ```
    *   Replace the path with the **absolute path** to the directory containing the source code you want to analyze. This is a security boundary - the tool will not access files outside this directory.

5.  **Configure Vibe Task Manager Read Directory (Optional):**
    *   To specify which directory the Vibe Task Manager is allowed to read from for security purposes, add this line to your `.env` file:
        ```dotenv
        VIBE_TASK_MANAGER_READ_DIR=/path/to/your/project/source/directory
        ```
    *   Replace the path with the **absolute path** to the directory containing your project files that the task manager should have access to.
    *   **Default Value**: If not specified, defaults to `process.cwd()` (the current working directory where the server is running).
    *   **Security**: This variable works with the filesystem security implementation that defaults to 'strict' mode, preventing access to system directories and unauthorized paths.
    *   **Note**: `VIBE_TASK_MANAGER_READ_DIR` (for task manager file operations), `CODE_MAP_ALLOWED_DIR` (for code analysis), and `VIBE_CODER_OUTPUT_DIR` (for writing output files) are separate security boundaries for different tool operations.

6.  **Review Other Settings (Optional):**
    *   You can add other environment variables supported by the server, such as `LOG_LEVEL` (e.g., `LOG_LEVEL=debug`) or `NODE_ENV` (e.g., `NODE_ENV=development`).

7.  **Save the `.env` File.**

### Step 5: Integrate with Your AI Assistant (MCP Settings)

This crucial step connects Vibe Coder to your AI assistant by adding its configuration to the client's MCP settings file.

#### 5.1: Locate Your Client's MCP Settings File

The location varies depending on your AI assistant:

*   **Cursor AI / Windsurf / RooCode (VS Code based):**
    1.  Open the application.
    2.  Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    3.  Type and select `Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)`.
    4.  This opens your `settings.json` file where the `mcpServers` object should reside.

*   **Cline AI (VS Code Extension):**
    *   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json`
    *   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
    *   **Linux**: `~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`
    *   *(Note: If using standard VS Code instead of Cursor, replace `Cursor` with `Code` in the path)*

*   **Claude Desktop:**
    *   **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    *   **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

#### 5.2: Add the Vibe Coder Configuration

1.  Open the settings file identified above in a text editor.
2.  Find the `"mcpServers": { ... }` JSON object. If it doesn't exist, you may need to create it (ensure the overall file remains valid JSON). For example, an empty file might become `{"mcpServers": {}}`.
3.  Add the following configuration block **inside** the curly braces `{}` of the `mcpServers` object. If other servers are already listed, add a comma `,` after the previous server's closing brace `}` before pasting this block.

    ```json
    // This is the unique identifier for this MCP server instance within your client's settings
    "vibe-coder-mcp": {
      // Specifies the command used to execute the server. Should be 'node' if Node.js is in your system's PATH
      "command": "node",
      // Provides the arguments to the 'command'. The primary argument is the absolute path to the compiled server entry point
      // !! IMPORTANT: Replace with the actual absolute path on YOUR system. Use forward slashes (/) even on Windows !!
      "args": ["/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP/build/index.js"],
      // Sets the current working directory for the server process when it runs
      // !! IMPORTANT: Replace with the actual absolute path on YOUR system. Use forward slashes (/) even on Windows !!
      "cwd": "/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP",
      // Defines the communication transport protocol between the client and server
      "transport": "stdio",
      // Environment variables to be passed specifically to the Vibe Coder server process when it starts
      // API Keys should be in the .env file, NOT here
      "env": {
        // Absolute path to the LLM configuration file used by Vibe Coder
        // !! IMPORTANT: Replace with the actual absolute path on YOUR system !!
        "LLM_CONFIG_PATH": "/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP/llm_config.json",
        // Sets the logging level for the server
        "LOG_LEVEL": "debug",
        // Specifies the runtime environment
        "NODE_ENV": "production",
        // Directory where Vibe Coder tools will save their output files
        // !! IMPORTANT: Replace with the actual absolute path on YOUR system !!
        "VIBE_CODER_OUTPUT_DIR": "/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP/VibeCoderOutput",
        // Directory that the code-map-generator tool is allowed to scan
        // This is a security boundary - the tool will not access files outside this directory
        "CODE_MAP_ALLOWED_DIR": "/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP/src",
        // Directory that the Vibe Task Manager is allowed to read from for security purposes
        // Defaults to process.cwd() if not specified. Works with strict security mode by default.
        "VIBE_TASK_MANAGER_READ_DIR": "/Users/username/Documents/Dev Projects/Vibe-Coder-MCP"
      },
      // A boolean flag to enable (false) or disable (true) this server configuration
      "disabled": false,
      // A list of tool names that the MCP client is allowed to execute automatically
      "autoApprove": [
        "research",
        "generate-rules",
        "generate-user-stories",
        "generate-task-list",
        "generate-prd",
        "generate-fullstack-starter-kit",
        "refactor-code",
        "git-summary",
        "run-workflow",
        "map-codebase"
      ]
    }
    ```

4.  **CRUCIAL:** Replace **all placeholder paths** (like `/path/to/your/vibe-coder-mcp/...`) with the correct **absolute paths** on your system where you cloned the repository. Use forward slashes `/` for paths, even on Windows (e.g., `C:/Users/YourName/Projects/vibe-coder-mcp/build/index.js`). Incorrect paths are the most common reason the server fails to connect.
5.  Save the settings file.
6.  **Completely close and restart** your AI assistant application (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop, etc.) for the changes to take effect.

### Step 6: Test Your Configuration

1. **Start Your AI Assistant:**
   * Completely restart your AI assistant application.

2. **Test a Simple Command:**
   * Type a test command like: `Research modern JavaScript frameworks`

3. **Check for Proper Response:**
   * If working correctly, you should receive a research response.
   * If not, check the Troubleshooting section below.
