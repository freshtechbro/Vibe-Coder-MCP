## ðŸš€ Demo Script

### **Opening (30 seconds)**

> "Today I'll show you the redesigned Repotools Chrome extension with a completely new interface based on user feedback. We've transformed the tool selection from individual cards to a streamlined dropdown, added file attachment capabilities, and created a comprehensive settings system."

### **1. New Popup Interface (2 minutes)**

**Step 1: Show the Header**
- Click the extension icon
- Point out the new header layout with logo and navigation icons

> "The new header provides quick access to key functions. We have the Repotools logo, and navigation icons for side panel, history, games, and settings."

**Step 2: Demonstrate Tools Dropdown**
- Click the tools dropdown
- Scroll through all 14 tools
- Select "Research" tool

> "Instead of scrolling through individual tool cards, we now have a clean dropdown with all 14 AI development tools. Each tool has its icon for quick identification."

**Step 3: Show File Attachment**
- Click the paperclip icon
- Select the test file (test-file.txt)
- Show the file appears below

> "Users can now attach files directly to their tool requests. This is perfect for code analysis, document processing, or providing context to AI tools."

**Step 4: Demonstrate Input/Output**
- Type a sample query: "Analyze this codebase structure"
- Click Send button
- Show the output area

> "The new input/output interface provides a clear workflow: select tool, attach files, enter query, and see results. The output appears right below for easy reference."

### **2. Enhanced Settings Page (2 minutes)**

**Step 1: Access Settings**
- Click the settings icon in popup header
- Show the settings page opens in new tab

> "The settings icon now opens a dedicated configuration page instead of a simple options dialog."

**Step 2: Show Tabbed Interface**
- Click through each tab: General, Tools, Appearance, Advanced
- Highlight the organized structure

> "We've organized settings into four logical sections. This makes it much easier to find and configure specific features."

**Step 3: Demonstrate Tool Configurations**
- Go to Tools tab
- Show the grid of tool cards
- Toggle a tool on/off
- Modify settings for one tool (max tokens, temperature, output format)

> "This is the game-changer - individual configuration for each of the 14 tools. Users can customize max tokens, temperature, output format, and even add custom prompts for each tool."

**Step 4: Show Other Settings**
- Briefly show General tab (server configuration)
- Show Appearance tab (theme selection)
- Show Advanced tab (performance and feature toggles)

> "The other tabs provide comprehensive control over the extension's behavior, appearance, and advanced features."

### **3. Design & UX Improvements (30 seconds)**

**Step 1: Highlight Design**
- Point out the glass morphism effects
- Show the consistent spacing and typography
- Demonstrate smooth transitions

> "We've maintained the beautiful glass design aesthetic while improving usability. The interface is more intuitive and provides better visual feedback."

**Step 2: Show Workflow Efficiency**
- Quickly demonstrate the complete workflow again
- Select tool â†’ attach file â†’ enter query â†’ execute

> "The new design reduces the number of clicks and provides a more streamlined workflow for using AI development tools."
