# File Search Service - Streaming Implementation

## Overview

Successfully transformed the FileSearchService from a limited collect-all-then-filter approach to an efficient stream-and-filter implementation that removes the 500-file limitation while improving memory efficiency.

## Key Changes

### 1. Removed File Limit
- **Before**: Hard-coded 500-file limit in `scanDirectory` method
- **After**: No file limits - processes entire codebases

### 2. Memory Efficiency
- **Before**: O(all files) memory usage - collected all files in array
- **After**: O(maxResults) memory usage - only keeps top results

### 3. Streaming Architecture
- **Added**: `scanDirectoryIterator` - async generator yielding one file at a time
- **Added**: `PriorityQueue` - maintains top N results efficiently
- **Added**: `streamingSearch` - generic streaming implementation
- **Added**: `contentSearchIterator` - specialized content search streaming

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Files are evaluated during traversal, not after collection
- Early filtering reduces unnecessary work
- Priority queue ensures only relevant results are kept

## Technical Implementation

### PriorityQueue Data Structure
```typescript
class PriorityQueue<T> {
  // Maintains top N items sorted by comparator function
  // O(log n) insertion, O(1) access to min score
  // Memory: O(maxSize) regardless of input size
}
```

### Streaming Flow
1. `scanDirectoryIterator` yields file paths one at a time
2. Each file is immediately evaluated against search criteria
3. Only files exceeding minimum score threshold are added to queue
4. Queue automatically maintains size limit and sort order
5. Final results extracted from queue

## Benefits

1. **No File Limits**: Can process repositories of any size
2. **Constant Memory**: Memory usage depends on maxResults, not directory size
3. **Better Performance**: Early filtering and no wasted collection
4. **Backward Compatible**: Public API unchanged
5. **Clean Architecture**: Enhanced existing code following DRY principles

## Usage

The public API remains unchanged:
```typescript
const results = await fileSearchService.searchFiles(projectPath, {
  pattern: 'search-term',
  maxResults: 100,
  searchStrategy: 'fuzzy'
});
```

Internally, the service now:
- Streams through all files without limits
- Uses only O(100) memory for results
- Processes files more efficiently
- Returns the same result format

## Testing

Comprehensive test coverage includes:
- PriorityQueue functionality
- Large directory handling (>1000 files)
- Memory efficiency validation
- Backward compatibility verification
- All search strategies tested

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. Progressive results callback for UI updates
2. Parallel directory scanning for performance
3. Configurable memory limits
4. Search cancellation support
