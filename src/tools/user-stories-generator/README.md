    "generate-prd",
    "research",
    "generate-task-list",
    "get-job-result"
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

#### Core Configuration
- **`OPENROUTER_API_KEY`**: Required API key for research integration via OpenRouter
- **`LLM_CONFIG_PATH`**: Path to LLM model configuration file for story generation
- **`VIBE_CODER_OUTPUT_DIR`**: Directory where user stories documents are saved
- **`LOG_LEVEL`**: Logging verbosity for user stories generation operations

#### User Stories-Specific Settings
- **`USER_STORIES_RESEARCH_ENABLED`**: Enable/disable research integration (default: true)
- **`USER_STORIES_TEMPLATE_TYPE`**: Default story template type (default: 'agile')
- **`USER_STORIES_GENERATION_TIMEOUT_MS`**: Generation timeout in milliseconds (default: 60000)
- **`USER_STORIES_PERSONA_COUNT`**: Number of user personas to generate (default: 3-5)

### LLM Configuration

The User Stories Generator uses models defined in `llm_config.json`:

```json
{
  "llm_mapping": {
    "user_stories_research": "perplexity/sonar-deep-research",
    "user_stories_generation": "google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview",
    "acceptance_criteria_generation": "google/gemini-2.5-flash-preview"
  }
}
```

## Inputs

This tool accepts the following parameters via the MCP call:

| Parameter            | Type        | Description                                       | Required |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `productDescription` | `string`    | Description of the product to create user stories for | Yes    |

*(Based on the Zod schema defined in `src/server.ts`)*

## Outputs

* **Primary Output:** A comprehensive set of user stories in Markdown format, hierarchically organized with acceptance criteria.
* **File Storage:** The generated artifact is saved for historical purposes to the configured output directory (default: `VibeCoderOutput/`, override with `VIBE_CODER_OUTPUT_DIR` env var):
  `[output_dir]/user-stories-generator/[timestamp]-[sanitized-name]-user-stories.md`
* **MCP Response:** The generated content is returned as text content within the MCP `CallToolResult`.

## Asynchronous Execution

This tool executes asynchronously due to the time required for research and LLM generation.
1.  When you call this tool, it will immediately return a **Job ID**.
2.  The user stories generation process runs in the background.
3.  Use the `get-job-result` tool with the received Job ID to retrieve the final user stories document once the job is complete.

## Workflow

When invoked, this tool performs the following steps:

1. **Input Validation:** The incoming product description parameter is validated.
2. **Research Phase (Pre-Generation):**
   * Formulates three specific queries based on the product description:
     * User personas and stakeholders
     * Common user workflows and use cases
     * User experience expectations and pain points
   * Executes these queries in parallel using the configured Perplexity model (`perplexity/sonar-deep-research` via `performResearchQuery`).
   * Aggregates the research results into a structured context block.
3. **Prompt Assembly:** Combines the original product description and the gathered research context into a comprehensive prompt for the main generation model.
4. **Generation Phase:**
   * Calls the `performDirectLlmCall` utility (`src/utils/llmHelper.ts`) with the assembled prompt and the user stories-specific system prompt (`USER_STORIES_SYSTEM_PROMPT`).
   * This directly uses the configured LLM (e.g., Gemini) to generate the user stories content as Markdown.
5. **Output Processing & Saving:**
   * Formats the generated Markdown user stories with a title header and timestamp.
   * Saves the user stories document to the `workflow-agent-files/user-stories-generator/` directory.
6. **Response:** Returns the formatted user stories content via the MCP protocol.

```

## Usage Example

From an MCP client (like Claude Desktop):

```
Generate user stories for a mobile app that helps users track their daily water intake, remind them to drink water, and visualize their hydration progress over time.
```

## System Prompt

The core generation logic uses `performDirectLlmCall` guided by the following system prompt (defined in `index.ts`):

```markdown
# User Stories Generator System Prompt Snippet
You are an AI assistant expert at generating comprehensive and well-structured user stories for software development projects.
Based on the provided product description and research context, generate detailed user stories.

## Using Research Context
* Carefully consider the **Pre-Generation Research Context** (provided by Perplexity) included in the main task prompt.
* This research contains valuable insights on user personas, workflows, and expectations.
* Use these insights to inform your user stories while keeping the focus on the primary product requirements.
* Pay special attention to the "User Personas & Stakeholders" and "User Workflows & Use Cases" sections in the research.

## User Story Template
| Field             | Description                                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| User Story ID     | A unique identifier (e.g., US-100, US-100.1)         |
| Title             | A concise summary of the user story                  |
| As a              | The user role benefiting from this functionality...  |
...
```

## Error Handling

* Handles invalid input parameters.
* Attempts to gracefully handle failures during the research phase (logs errors, proceeds without research context).
* Reports errors during the main generation phase.
* Handles potential errors during file saving (typically logs warning and proceeds).
* Returns specific error messages via MCP response when failures occur.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Research integration failed"
**Cause**: OpenRouter API key missing or research service unavailable
**Solution**: Verify API configuration and enable fallback mode

```bash
# Check API key configuration
grep OPENROUTER_API_KEY .env

# Enable fallback mode in environment
USER_STORIES_RESEARCH_ENABLED=false
```

#### "Story generation timeout"
**Cause**: Generation taking longer than configured timeout
**Solution**: Increase timeout or simplify product description

```json
// In environment variables
"USER_STORIES_GENERATION_TIMEOUT_MS": "120000"  // Increase to 2 minutes
```

#### "Insufficient story detail"
**Cause**: Generated stories lack detailed acceptance criteria
**Solution**: Provide more detailed product description or enable comprehensive research

```json
// Enable comprehensive research
"USER_STORIES_RESEARCH_ENABLED": "true"
"USER_STORIES_PERSONA_COUNT": "5"  // Increase persona count
```

### Performance Optimization

#### For Faster Generation
- Use basic research depth for simple products
- Reduce persona count for faster processing
- Use cached templates for similar products
- Simplify product descriptions to reduce processing time

#### For Better Quality
- Enable comprehensive research depth
- Provide detailed product descriptions with user context
